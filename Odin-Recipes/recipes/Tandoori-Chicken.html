    <h1 class="title">Tandoori Chicken</h1>
    
    <p>Try this authentic tandoori chicken that's marinated in yogurt and spices,
        then cooked on the grill instead of a clay oven so you can make it at home.
        Serve with long-grain basmati rice, grilled veggies, roasted corn on the cob,
        and a cucumber salad.
